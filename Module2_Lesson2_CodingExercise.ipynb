    "# Python Coding Exercise for Module 2, Lesson 2: Subset Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a Python function that performs forward stepwise selection to identify a subset of predictor variables that are most related to a target variable in a linear regression context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your tasks are to write a function that satisfies the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accept three parameters: X, a pandas DataFrame of predictor variables; y, a pandas Series of the target variable; and criterion, a string that specifies the metric used for variable selection (e.g., 'AIC', 'BIC', 'R-squared').\n",
    "- Start with an empty model and iteratively add the variable that improves the model the most based on the specified criterion until no variables improve the model.\n",
    "- Return a list of models with scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the statsmodels library to fit linear regression models.\n",
    "- Assume that X and y have been preprocessed and are ready for modeling (e.g., no missing values or categorical variables needing encoding).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we have not discussed this yet, the smaller AIC and BIC scores are, the better. So you will need to adjust the previous code of forward stepwise selection to choose smaller values over larger ones. You are also provided with several functions that you can use to answer the questions. "
